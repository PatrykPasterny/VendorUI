# VendorUI
VendorUI is a RPG type shop created using C#, EF6 and WPF. 
4 different types of items can be sold, bought, consumed, disassembled and sorted. The amount of objects in both directories can be very large, without visible performance loss. To test it you can click 'SetLargeDatabase' button on the main window. Set default database brings you back to the first states of User and Vendor's equipment. When you set up new Database using this buttons it is recommended to reload the program to reload the database, because otherwise a primary key conflicts may occur.
